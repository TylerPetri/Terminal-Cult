============================================================
                    ⟦ TERMINAL CULT ⟧
     A sacred order of unstable wizards, compiler outlaws,
               and code necromancers since ????
============================================================

  “We don’t patch the bugs — we inherit them.”

  ▓ ORIGIN ▓
    The Terminal Cult emerged from within the forgotten corners of 
    80s BBS systems and unstable UNIX forks. Born of crashes, race 
    conditions, and the horror of recursive chmods, they are not 
    a group — they are a presence. Operating outside the kernel 
    space of time.

------------------------------------------------------------
  ⚙️ DOCTRINE
------------------------------------------------------------
  • Every bug is a message.
  • Every daemon is sacred.
  • Every patch is temporary.
  • Silence is a valid return type.
  • `exit 0` is a form of prayer.
