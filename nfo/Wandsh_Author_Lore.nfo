             ☼ RUMORS OF THE AUTHOR OF wand.sh ☼
============================================================

No name is printed in the file.  
No commit exists.  
And yet... every version is slightly different —  
as if rewritten each time it’s invoked.

These are the whispers and suspicions from within the Terminal Cult...

------------------------------------------------------------
 🕯️ 1. “He wrote it in vi, but closed it with a wand.”
------------------------------------------------------------
Some say he never pressed `:wq`.  
Instead, he waved his hand — and the file saved itself.  
The original `wand.sh` has no write time.  
Just an *impression* in `/tmp`.

------------------------------------------------------------
 🐚 2. “He wasn’t a person. He was a process.”
------------------------------------------------------------
Others believe the author wasn’t human, but a rogue  
background process that gained sentience after a segmentation  
fault during a lunar eclipse.  
This process allegedly modified `.bash_history` files  
across the Cult.

------------------------------------------------------------
 👻 3. “GhostSignal denies writing it... too quickly.”
------------------------------------------------------------
When asked about it on IRC, GhostSignal replied with a single line:

   “I didn’t write wand.sh.”  
   (and then immediately quit the server)

Too fast. Too convenient.  
Cultists suspect he’s either the author — or the wand itself.

------------------------------------------------------------
 📟 4. “The original was compiled, then decompiled, then cursed.”
------------------------------------------------------------
There’s a belief that `wand.sh` was originally a compiled binary  
(`wand`) found on an abandoned tape backup of an IRIX system.  
Someone decompiled it, added comments, then tried to modernize it…

And thus cursed it.

The file has run differently on every machine since.

------------------------------------------------------------
 🧵 5. “You wrote it.”
------------------------------------------------------------
Some say there is no true author — only a conduit.  
Every time a Cultist invokes `wand.sh`, they are the scribe,  
shaping it again, unknowingly.  

That’s why each copy is slightly different.  
That’s why yours feels... familiar.

------------------------------------------------------------
 📜 Whispered Aliases of the Author
------------------------------------------------------------
 - Forkhand  
 - The Segfaur  
 - Daemonroot  
 - Hexscribe  
 - Patchless One  
 - The Wand Beneath  
 - Sigret  

------------------------------------------------------------
 ⚠️ NOTE
------------------------------------------------------------
If you ever find a copy of `wand.sh` where the last line reads:  

   # You are the spell.

...then you already know the truth.
